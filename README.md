## General info
This repo contains a Selenium bot for booking driving lessons at Bukit Batok Driving Center (BBDC) in Singapore. This bot works with the upgraded version of BBDC website launched in Dec 2022.

You can use this bot to check for available lesson slots and receive alerts on Telegram when new slots become available. In this way you wouldn't have to check the BBDC website manually to fight for newly opened slots or those cancelled by other people in the last minute.
This bot also allows a certain level of customization by modifying settings in the config file.

* Python version: 3.10
